MapReduce is a programming model used for processing large data sets in parallel across a distributed computing environment. It is typically used in big data frameworks like Hadoop to handle massive amounts of data by breaking down the process into two main functions:

1. **Map**: This function takes input data and processes it into key-value pairs. The input data is divided into smaller chunks, and the `map` function is applied to each chunk independently, producing intermediate key-value pairs.
  
2. **Reduce**: The `reduce` function aggregates or processes the intermediate key-value pairs. It takes the output from the `map` function and combines or reduces the data to generate a final output.

In essence, MapReduce allows for efficient and scalable data processing by distributing the workload across multiple nodes and performing the tasks in parallel. It's especially useful for tasks like indexing, data mining, and analyzing logs.

Example of a simple MapReduce implementation in Python using Python's built-in `map` and `reduce` functions (with the `reduce` function coming from the `functools` module). This example calculates the word count for a list of sentences.

```python
from functools import reduce
from collections import defaultdict

# Example data: list of sentences
data = [
    "MapReduce is a programming model",
    "MapReduce is used for processing large data sets",
    "MapReduce involves map and reduce functions"
]

# Map function: tokenize and emit key-value pairs
def map_function(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    return [(word, 1) for word in words]

# Reduce function: sum up the values for each key (word)
def reduce_function(word_count1, word_count2):
    for word, count in word_count2.items():
        word_count1[word] += count
    return word_count1

# Applying the Map phase
mapped = [map_function(sentence) for sentence in data]

# Flatten the list of lists into a single list of word-count pairs
flattened = [pair for sublist in mapped for pair in sublist]

# Convert the flattened list to a dictionary for aggregation
mapped_dict = defaultdict(int)
for word, count in flattened:
    mapped_dict[word] += count

# Applying the Reduce phase
word_counts = reduce(reduce_function, [mapped_dict])

# Output the final word counts
print(dict(word_counts))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Map phase**: Each sentence is split into words, and each word is paired with the number `1` (indicating a single occurrence).
2. **Reduce phase**: The word counts are aggregated by summing up the occurrences of each word.

### Output:
```python
{
  'MapReduce': 3,
  'is': 2,
  'a': 1,
  'programming': 1,
  'model': 1,
  'used': 1,
  'for': 1,
  'processing': 1,
  'large': 1,
  'data': 1,
  'sets': 1,
  'involves': 1,
  'map': 1,
  'and': 1,
  'reduce': 1,
  'functions': 1
}
``` 

This demonstrates a simple word count example using the MapReduce model.
